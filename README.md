## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mygpt.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd mygpt
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the necessary environment variables:

   ```
   touch .env.local
   ```

   Add the following to the `.env.local` file:

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   MONGODB_URI=yourURI
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=yourSecret
   ```

   Replace `yourURI` with your MongoDB connection string and `yourSecret` with a secure random string.

## Usage

- To run the development server:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- To build the application for production:

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

- To start the production server:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```

## Deployment

To deploy your MyGPT Clone to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account if you haven't already.

2. Install the Vercel CLI:

   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. Log in to your Vercel account from the command line:

   ```
   vercel login
   ```

4. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```
   cd mygpt
   ```

5. Run the following command to deploy your application:

   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

6. During the deployment process, the Vercel CLI will ask you for the environment variables. Provide the same values you used for your `.env.local` file:

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL: https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
   MONGODB_URI: yourURI
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET: yourSecret
   ```

   Replace `your-vercel-url` with the URL generated by Vercel, `yourURI` with your MongoDB connection string, and `yourSecret` with the secure random string you used in the `.env.local` file.

7. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a live URL to access your MyGPT Clone.

Remember that every time you make changes to your MyGPT Clone and want to deploy the updated version, you can simply run `vercel --prod` from the project directory.
