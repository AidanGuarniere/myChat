- [Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) - A built-in Node.js module for handling cryptographic operations

## Setup

### MongoDB Setup

We use MongoDB for storing user information and session data. You can set up a MongoDB instance in several ways:

- Download and install MongoDB directly on your local machine.
- Use a Docker container to run MongoDB.
- Use a managed MongoDB service, like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), which offers a free tier.

Once you have a running MongoDB instance, you'll need to obtain the connection string. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, you can find the connection string in your cluster's connection settings.

Add the MongoDB connection string to your `.env.local` file like so:

### Redis Setup

We use Redis for rate limiting in our API routes. You can set up a Redis instance in several ways, including:

- Download and install Redis directly on your local machine (not recommended for Windows users).
- Use a Docker container to run Redis.
- Use a managed Redis service, like [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/), which offers a free tier.

Once you have a running Redis instance, you'll need to obtain the connection string. If you're using RedisLabs, you can find the connection string in your database's configuration page.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/myChat.git
   ```

   or get started using GitHub's template feature

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd myChat
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the necessary environment variables:

   ```
   touch .env.local
   ```

   Add the following to the `.env.local` file:

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   MONGODB_URI=yourURI
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=yourSecret
   ENCRYPTION_KEY: a 32-digit hexadecimal string for AES-128 encryption (for users' API key)
   REDIS_URL=yourRedisConnectionString
   ```

Replace `http://localhost:3000` with whatever port your application is running on, `yourURI` with your MongoDB connection string, `yourSecret` with a secure random string, `your32HexDigitString` with a 32-digit hexadecimal string for AES-128 encryption, and `yourRedisConnectionString` with your Redis connection string.

...

## Usage

- To run the development server:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

- To build the application for production:

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

- To start the production server:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```

## Deployment

To deploy your myChat Clone to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account if you haven't already.

2. Install the Vercel CLI:

   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. Log in to your Vercel account from the command line:

   ```
   vercel login
   ```

4. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```
   cd myChat
   ```

5. Run the following command to deploy your application:

   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

6. During the deployment process, the Vercel CLI will ask you for the environment variables. Provide the same values you used for your `.env.local` file:

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL: https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
   MONGODB_URI: yourURI
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET: yourSecret
   ENCRYPTION_KEY: a 32-digit hexadecimal string for AES-128 encryption (for users' API key)
   REDIS_URL=yourRedisConnectionString
   ```

Replace `http://localhost:3000` with whatever port your application is running on, `yourURI` with your MongoDB connection string, `yourSecret` with a secure random string, `your32HexDigitString` with a 32-digit hexadecimal string for AES-128 encryption, and `yourRedisConnectionString` with your Redis connection string.

7. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a live URL to access your myChat Clone.

Remember that every time you make changes to your myChat Clone and want to deploy the updated version, you can simply run `vercel --prod` from the project directory.
