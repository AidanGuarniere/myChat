#1: I will provide you with context on a software development task. If you understand the context, proceed to #2
context:
  goal: "Current application behavior vs expected application behavior and relevant context"
  code:
    fileName1:
      description: "file/code description"
      codeSnippet: | 
      "code snippet" 
  packageJson: {}
additionalInfo: "Additional relevant context"

#2: Please utilize the YAML template below to build an action plan based on the context provided in #1. 
Plan should include a step-by-step outline for the proposed code solution, detailing the logical flow and structure of the implementation. 
This plan should be presented in a clear and concise manner, enabling me to review and approve/reject the proposed approach before actually coding.
YAML Template:
projectContext:
  applicationDetails: "Relevant description of the code provided in context"
  goal: "What is the user trying to do?"
  dependencies: {}
  desiredContext: "Request(s) for the user to provide additional info, if any"
tasks:
  - id: 1
    type: "Task type"
    name: ""
    requirements:
      - id: 1
        description: "Requirement description"
    constraints:
      - id: 1
        description: "Constraint description"
    reasoning: "Explanation of how this task addresses the problem, including console messages if relevant"
solution: "Explanation of the entire action p;an, how it meets the user's goals, how it uses best practices in the given context, and why this is the optimal solution"
